It requires preparing the input text to align with the model's required format, running the model autoregressively, and sampling during each iteration. Consequently, once the user has successfully converted their model into `tflite` format (comprising the model's graph and parameters), it becomes essential to augment it with additional metadata to ensure end-to-end execution of the model.\n","\n","Task bundler offers a practical approach to creating such bundles.
